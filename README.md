## How to use it without writing new code?
You need an OpenAI API key if you are going to use my api wrappers. Just create a file in the project root directory called "apiKeys.py" and add the next line: "apiKey_openai = write-here-your-key"

Then you can launch the example file called main.py, here are the instruction how to use it: 
1. Write in the terminal "1" to start recording your microphone.
2. Then write "2" to stop recording, and get a response from the bot. 
3. Return to the first step.

You can write "0" to see all your conversation as messages.

Your microphone recordings are converted into text using the OpenAI API.
Text responses are generated by using OpenAI API.
Responses from the AI are voiced by using gTTS.
